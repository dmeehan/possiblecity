It seeks to create a new relationship between citizens, organizations, government, design professionals and the physical, social, and economic spaces that they inhabit. The Possible City will be a framework for developing a symbiotic network of continuous experimentation, feedback, and synthesis that is more in-tune with the city as a complex and evolving entity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>What happens next will be powered by individual innovation and collaborative sharing. We are on the verge of a massive mutual co-arising.&nbsp;- Bre Petis (founder of Makerbot)</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Possible City seeks to create a local economy built around rebuilding the city. Our initial focus will be on the cities forgotten spaces \u2014 Those places which have for one reason or another vexed the established political and economic structures, those places for which existing planning processes and techniques have failed. We believe that the Possible City will emerge from these forgotten spaces, and that the plan for the &nbsp;future city will emerge from the Possible City in a constant state of making and remaking. And because of our history, because we believe in the necessity of connecting the virtual with physical specificity, and because of its history and inherent qualities, the Possible City will focus its initial efforts in Philadelphia and Brooklyn.</p>\n\n<p>Possible City is in the process of developing a series of tools to instigate this process:</p>\n<h4><b>Free Agent</b></h4>\n\n<p>Possible City is built to support the agency of individuals to instigate change in their own communities (and to eventually make a living doing it). Users of the site will be able to create Agent profiles through which they will interact with Projects, Lots, and other Agents. These profiles will allow Agents to share information about their location, their interests, projects they have \"floated\", Projects they have \"grounded\", Projects they are backing, Lots they are following, other Agents they are networked with, and skills and expertise they can bring to rebuilding their communities. People with particular expertise such as engineering, design, construction, community organization, planning, legal etc, can advertise these skills on their profiles. Initially, we will be on recruiting designers to populate the site with project ideas and developing tools for designers to instigate projects. Over time, designers will be able to pool resources and form loose collectives to work on projects -- a disruption of current design practice.</p>\n<h4><b>lotXlot</b></h4>\n\n<p>lotXlot is an application for mapping the city on a parcel by parcel basis. It allows Agents to locate \"Lots\" with specific characteristics, gather up-to-date data about them, add their own data, \"Follow\" them, &nbsp;become \"Stewards\", and connect them with other Agents and Projects. The initial focus of lotXlot will be vacant lots, but every parcel in the city will have its own profile page and will be open to intervention. Lots can be networked together physically by location (<b>clusters</b> of lots connected to each other, <b>corridors</b> of lots connected by another physical structure in the city such as a transit line, or stream bed, and <b>networks</b> of lots - connected not physically but virtually by defining characteristics or uses)</p>\n<h4><b>Float</b></h4>\n\n<p>Float is an application that will allow Agents to \"float\" projects for specific locations in the city. The ideas can range from simple seed ideas to more fully realized projects. Once the ideas have been floated, other agents can comment, join, support, and fund the realization of the project. &nbsp;Eventually, tools will be developed to help interested agents to \"ground\" the project - where the project transitions from the virtual space to physical ground. &nbsp;Related projects can be networked with each other to allow those involved to share knowledge and resources and begin to populate the city with new emergent physical and social &nbsp;structures.</p>\n<h3>Genesis</h3>\n\n<p>Possible City grew out of work that Douglas Meehan did starting in 2005 while a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design.

The website was initially conceived as place to organize and exhibit the competition entries and provide resources for interested parties to extract actionable items. But as he worked on the site, Doug began to think that it could become something more. He wondered if the site could become not only a one-way disseminator of information like pamphlets of old, but a two way exchange of ideas and inspiration.

Its uncanny how many of the things they are coming up with are exactly things I've been thinking. I swear I'm not just stealing all their ideas! For example, I went for a run this afternoon where I tend to do a lot of my best thinking. A passing though came to me of labeling projects S,M,L,XL (as a play on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/S-M-XL-Rem-Koolhaas/dp/1885254865\">Rem Koolhaas monograph</a>&nbsp;of the same name).

The format of this challenge has been particularly useful, as each entry is open to comments from public and can be updated as feedback is given. This has enabled us to keep pushing to clarify what we are doing, and we've been updating our entry based on questions and critique we have received. Below is our mission statement in its most current iteration:</p>\r\n<h3>What's the Big Idea?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible City is an experiment in engaging the city's forgotten spaces to bridge a crucial gap in current urban planning practice. Top-down master planning, while cohesive and potentially visionary, is static and often insensitive to the needs of communities and individuals. Bottom-up advocacy planning addresses these issues, but can be fragmented and fall victim to \"design by committee\". The Web provides the virtual medium for a sophisticated new approach whereby an organized vision for an entire city can emerge from networks of citizens working to improve their local environments . Vacant land provides the physical medium, open to transformative new possibilities. Neither top down, nor bottom up, Possible City is a web-based framework for a symbiotic network of continuous experimentation, feedback, and synthesis more in-tune with the city as a complex and evolving entity.</p>\r\n<h3>Where to Start?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Philadelphia, like many post-industrial cities in the U.S. has an issue with vacant land. Current research estimates the number at over 40,000 vacant lots. This is over 5000 acres, or over 8 square miles of land. Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of this land is situated in under-served and economically impoverished neighborhoods and the individual parcels are small and fragmented. These conditions leave a combined area bigger than that of Center City largely incompatible with traditional economic and political structures; a whole segment of the city for which established planning processes and techniques have failed. At Possible City, we see these conditions as an opportunity rather than a problem to be solved.</p>\r\n<h3>What Do We Plan to Do About It?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Possible City seeks to create community and economy structured around re-purposing vacant and underutilized land for innovative new uses. First, we plan to uncover people and organizations who are already working in this space and provide tools and community to strengthen and enhance their projects. &nbsp;Second, we want to inspire and empower additional entrepreneurs, designers, activists, artists, and everyday citizens to capitalize on the opportunities presented through vacancy. Third, we want to connect these individuals and groups together to amplify their impact on a city-wide scale. Fourth, we want to feed this information back into governments and institutions so that they can develop policies and programs to support these emergent structures. We believe that the Possible City will emerge from the city's forgotten spaces, and that the plan for the &nbsp;future city will emerge from the Possible City in a constant state of making and remaking.</p>\r\n<h3>How Are We Going to Do It?</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>City processes in real life are too complex to be routine, too particularized for application as abstractions. They are always made up of interactions among unique combinations of particulars, and there is no substitute for knowing the particulars. <br>\r\n - Jane Jacobs</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible City is developing a set of tools to address \"the particulars\" and to network these particulars together in a holistic way. We will focus on the most fundamental building blocks of a city: 1. citizens 2. parcels of land 3. ideas. We are building a set of networked web applications to address each category. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Free Agent</b><br>\r\n Free Agent consists of user profiles of people interested in developing their own agency in the city - a place for individuals to express an interest in making a direct impact in their neighborhood. People can share what they would like to help create as well as what they are able to offer, whether that be time, money, materials, or expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>lotXlot</b><br>\r\n lotXlot is an application for mapping the city on a parcel by parcel basis, starting with open data provided by the city. It allows Agents to locate \"Lots\" with specific characteristics, gather up-to-date data about them, add their own data, and organize around them. The initial focus of lotXlot will be vacant lots, but every parcel in the city will have its own profile page and will be open to intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Float</b><br>\r\n Float allows Agents to \"float\" interventions for specific lots in the city. The interventions can range from simple seed ideas to more fully realized projects. Once the concepts have been floated, other Agents can comment, join, support, and fund the realization of the project -- together they begin to \"ground\" the project - where the project transitions from the virtual space to physical ground. Related projects can be networked with each other to allow those involved to share knowledge and resources and begin to populate the city with new emergent physical and social structures.</p>\r\n<h4>The Networks and The Marketplace</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>What happens next will be powered by individual innovation and collaborative sharing. We are on the verge of a massive mutual co-arising.<br>\r\n - Bre Petis (founder of Makerbot)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>By connecting, organizing, and mapping citizens, land, and ideas through the tools outlined above, Possible City will visualize the formation of &nbsp;networks around topics such as Food, Energy, Health, Education, and Public Space. We plan to support these networks through the creation of virtual marketplaces for the exchange of ideas, time, and resources. We believe that citizens can develop more equitable and authentic economic opportunities by leveraging economies of agglomeration to compete with traditional economies of scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we can build a community of governance focused on agency and experimentation. Rather than guessing about what urban redevelopment policies might work, we can test them out, find examples that work, and support those emergent networks of action. <b>Possible City will not only give people a voice in urban development, it will also help to give shape to that voice.</b></p>\r\n",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of this land is situated in under-served and economically impoverished neighborhoods and the individual parcels are small and fragmented. These conditions leave a combined area bigger than that of Center City largely incompatible with traditional economic and political structures; a whole segment of the city for which established planning processes and techniques have failed. At Possible City, we see these conditions as an opportunity rather than a problem to be solved.</p>\r\n<h3>What Do We Plan to Do About It?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Possible City seeks to create community and economy structured around re-purposing vacant and underutilized land for innovative new uses. First, we plan to uncover people and organizations who are already working in this space and provide tools and community to strengthen and enhance their projects. &nbsp;Second, we want to inspire and empower additional entrepreneurs, designers, activists, artists, and everyday citizens to capitalize on the opportunities presented through vacancy. Third, we want to connect these individuals and groups together to amplify their impact on a city-wide scale. Fourth, we want to feed this information back into governments and institutions so that they can develop policies and programs to support these emergent structures. We believe that the Possible City will emerge from the city's forgotten spaces, and that the plan for the &nbsp;future city will emerge from the Possible City in a constant state of making and remaking.</p>\r\n<h3>How Are We Going to Do It?</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>City processes in real life are too complex to be routine, too particularized for application as abstractions. They are always made up of interactions among unique combinations of particulars, and there is no substitute for knowing the particulars. <br>\r\n - Jane Jacobs</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible City is developing a set of tools to address \"the particulars\" and to network these particulars together in a holistic way. We will focus on the most fundamental building blocks of a city: 1. citizens 2. parcels of land 3. ideas. We are building a set of networked web applications to address each category. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Free Agent</b><br>\r\n Free Agent consists of user profiles of people interested in developing their own agency in the city - a place for individuals to express an interest in making a direct impact in their neighborhood. People can share what they would like to help create as well as what they are able to offer, whether that be time, money, materials, or expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>lotXlot</b><br>\r\n lotXlot is an application for mapping the city on a parcel by parcel basis, starting with open data provided by the city. It allows Agents to locate \"Lots\" with specific characteristics, gather up-to-date data about them, add their own data, and organize around them. The initial focus of lotXlot will be vacant lots, but every parcel in the city will have its own profile page and will be open to intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Float</b><br>\r\n Float allows Agents to \"float\" interventions for specific lots in the city. The interventions can range from simple seed ideas to more fully realized projects. Once the concepts have been floated, other Agents can comment, join, support, and fund the realization of the project -- together they begin to \"ground\" the project - where the project transitions from the virtual space to physical ground. Related projects can be networked with each other to allow those involved to share knowledge and resources and begin to populate the city with new emergent physical and social structures.</p>\r\n<h4>The Networks and The Marketplace</h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>What happens next will be powered by individual innovation and collaborative sharing. We are on the verge of a massive mutual co-arising.<br>\r\n - Bre Petis (founder of Makerbot)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>By connecting, organizing, and mapping citizens, land, and ideas through the tools outlined above, Possible City will visualize the formation of &nbsp;networks around topics such as Food, Energy, Health, Education, and Public Space. We plan to support these networks through the creation of virtual marketplaces for the exchange of ideas, time, and resources. We believe that citizens can develop more equitable and authentic economic opportunities by leveraging economies of agglomeration to compete with traditional economies of scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we can build a community of governance focused on agency and experimentation. Rather than guessing about what urban redevelopment policies might work, we can test them out, find examples that work, and support those emergent networks of action. <b>Possible City will not only give people a voice in urban development, it will also help to give shape to that voice.</b></p>\r\n",
